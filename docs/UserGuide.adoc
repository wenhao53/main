== Introduction

Personal Trainer Pro (PTP) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing clients*. More importantly, PTP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Personal Trainers can make use of the application to manage their clients, schedule appointments, and view their clients' progress. If you can type fast, PTP can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]

+
.  Download the latest `PTP.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
