== PROJECT: Personal Trainer Pro Application

---

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *integrated Google Calendar Services*
** What it does: Through the 'calendar' and 'addEvent' command, users can display their Google Calendar within the application, and also add new events to their Google Calendar through CLI.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it allows users to have increased ease in the management of their schedule. It can be troublesome to have to switch between applications when planning one's schedule. This feature allows the user to do everything within the application itself, allowing them to finish planning quicker and more efficiently.
** Highlights: This enhancement touched on all the different components of the code from User Interface to the Model component. Therefore, it required a deep understanding of how the different component interacts with one another. Also, since Google Calendar is integrated, it requires knowledge on how the Google Calendar API works and how to set it up, making it very challenging to implement.
** Credits: Google Calendar API was used to allow Google Calendar services to be integrated into the application.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a weight attribute that stores the users' weight, which is essential since this is a fitness application.

* *Minor enhancement*: revamped the UI from a dark theme to a brighter and more positive light theme to match our product, which is a fitness application.
